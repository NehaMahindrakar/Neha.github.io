<h1>Designing a new Web-page is easy. <br>Committing your time and following through <br>with that original concept, that's the tricky part.</h1><br>

<p>I have recently started working on Web-development.I have been learning<br>
HTML since 2015.Whne I joined my engineering college, I stopped working on it<br>
due to academics and other high level stuff, but I have been coming back to it<br>
over these  few months. It's undergone countless iterations.<br><br>

<p>I started working again by taking several courses on Web-development<br>
through online platforms.I started with Cascading Style Sheets ,java-script<br>
and bootstrap too.I would recommend it to you too.Check out online<br>
courses, from various platforms.It did take time to learn, but it is worth it.<br>
And also lot of fun.<br>


<p>If anyone is interested in learning web-design, I would love to make <br>
documnents and papers.So that you can download them and learn easily.<br>
In the next few weeks I'm also going to write about the decisions<br>
 I made while building out this site - inspiration, evolution,<br> 
content management, execution. Hopefully it may be of some use<br>
 to those starting out with building their first portfolio <br>
 - maybe help shave a year or two off it here and there!<br>
